Programming Project 
Reduced Representation of a Protein Structure

Task 2
Parsing Protein extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)


1.The program is written in python.
2.Run the program in the directory saved as test.py.
3.Enter the protein structure file name as input with pdb extension.
4.The output file is generated for reduced representation of a side chain is the geometric center of side chain atoms is output.pdb.
5.output.pdb gives the geometric center of side chain atoms.
6.The output file is generated for reduced representation of a helix is a set of points near the central axis of the helix is output2.pdb
7.output2.pdb gives the geometric center of consecutive CA atoms
8.The output file is generated for he reduced representation of a beta-strand is a set of points near the central line of the beta-strand is output3.pdb
9.Load the output files in Chimera to view the visualization.

Sample Testing data used:
The program works for following pdb files:
1aop
1NVS
1aky
